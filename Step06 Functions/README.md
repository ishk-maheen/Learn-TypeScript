Functions:
A function is a block of code that can be called multiple times with different inputs.

BLOCK SCOPES IN FUNTCTIONS:
*Local Scope:
A variable defined within a function or block has local scope. It is only accessible within that specific function or block and cannot be accessed outside of it.

*Global Scope:
A variable defined outside of any function or block has global scope. It is accessible from anywhere in the code.

*Lexical Scope:
Lexical scope, also known as static scope, is the scope defined by the structure of the code. It determines the accessibility of variables based on their physical location in the code.

In lexical scope, a variable is accessible within the block it is defined in and any nested blocks, but not outside of that block.


Types Of Functions:
1. Normal Functions: The typical functions we define with the function keyword.

2. Arrow Functions: Concise functions defined with the => operator, often used as callbacks or for simple operations.

3. Method Functions: Functions that are part of a class or object, used to perform actions on that object.

4. Async Functions: Functions that return a Promise, used for asynchronous operations.
